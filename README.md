Hey, I'm Ben and I enjoy all sorts of technology and hope to make a career out of it someday. 

I am currently an online student at Bethel Tech and I'm learning a lot about coding.

Status as of now: -I'm basicly trash-

Good news is, I don't plan on quitting anytime soon. 👍

If money was no object I would buy Windows...
